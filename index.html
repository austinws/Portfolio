                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>My name is Austin Smith and I am learning to become a web developer.
                        Computers are a passion of mine and I have always wanted to know how they work. 
                        As a teenager, I would take them apart to get the magnets in the hard drives.
                        As an adult, I like to learn the code that makes them function.
                    </p>
